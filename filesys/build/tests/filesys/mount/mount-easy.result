FAIL
Test output failed to match any acceptable form.

Acceptable output:
  (mount-easy) begin
  (mount-easy) mkdir "/a"
  (mount-easy) mount the second disk at "/a"
  Formatting file system...done.
  (mount-easy) chdir "/a"
  (mount-easy) mkdir "/a/b"
  (mount-easy) chdir "/a/b"
  (mount-easy) pop back to "/"
  (mount-easy) unmount the second disk from "/a"
  (mount-easy) chdir to unmounted directory (must fail)
  (mount-easy) mount the second disk at "/a"
  (mount-easy) chdir to re-mounted directory
  (mount-easy) end
Differences in `diff -u' format:
  (mount-easy) begin
  (mount-easy) mkdir "/a"
- (mount-easy) mount the second disk at "/a"
- Formatting file system...done.
- (mount-easy) chdir "/a"
- (mount-easy) mkdir "/a/b"
- (mount-easy) chdir "/a/b"
- (mount-easy) pop back to "/"
- (mount-easy) unmount the second disk from "/a"
- (mount-easy) chdir to unmounted directory (must fail)
- (mount-easy) mount the second disk at "/a"
- (mount-easy) chdir to re-mounted directory
- (mount-easy) end
+ system call!
